The route and rolling stock of the Orient Express changed many times. Several routes in the past concurrently used the Orient Express name, or slight variants thereof.
Although the original Orient Express was simply a normal international railway service, the name has become synonymous with intrigue and luxury travel.
The two city names most prominently associated with the Orient Express are Paris and Istanbul, the original endpoints of the timetabled service.

CIWL soon developed a dense network of luxury trains all over Europe, whose names are still remembered today and associated with the art of luxury travel
such as the Blue Train, the Golden Arrow, North Express and many more.
